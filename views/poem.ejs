I. In Delaware the diamond State 
There lived a boy of the 1st rate 
His girl friend lived not very far away 
And she is so doggone sweet, he'd say

II. She went to take care of her sisters tiny boy 
At first it seemed to her quite a joy 
But soon it seemed like a terrible fate 
For she left her boy friend in another state

III. Soon Andy a letter to her did write 
And she came home on Saturday nite 
All that night they did nothing but court 
They thought, What a doggone sweet sport

IV. The next day Eva had to keep rubbing her eye 
To keep it open and the reason why 
Is because she's always so clean and neat 
But best of all she's so doggone sweet

V. On Monday they went boat riding on the lake 
This is true and not just a fake 
The day was too short for such good sport 
A doggone sweet time to fish and court

VI. In the afternoon to the airport they went 
There an exciting afternoon did spent 
They thought an airplane ride they'd take 
But then were afraid the engine might break

VII. To Sam Hertyler's with one crowd they went that eve.
And both enjoyed it I truly believe 
Till the time came that they had to part 
The doggone sweet time was erased from each heart

VIII. That night Eva to Pa. had to return. 
Oh how it made Andy's heart thump and burn 
She went to the porch her suitcase to get 
Said Andy "I can't let you go to Pa. yet"

IX. He followed her in as on the porch she went 
And there several minutes together they spent 
Andy said " I wish you wouldn't to Pa. go 
You are so doggone sweet you know"

X. But for Pa. that night she had to leave 
and Andy’s heart was filled with grief 
Then home to bed poor Andy went 
And then a sleepless night did spent

XI. Thought he if Eva was only here 
She could sleep beside me right here 
Then how happy would I be 
Oh she's so doggone sweet you see

XII. Soon Eva a big letter sent to him 
He read and read till his eyes grew dim 
She told him in Elam's shop is work to do 
So Please do come, it's waiting on you

XIII. A happy thought flashed through his mind 
I'll do just that if work I can find 
For Andy you know is never a shirk 
He's always doing some kind of work

XIV. He packed his suitcase and left next day 
For Pennsylvania the railroad way 
Thought he when I get there, what a treat 
To see my girl that's so doggone sweet

XV. In Pa they worked side by side 
As happy as are the groom and bride 
The reason why is very clear 
No parting words were ever said here

XVI. They worked for Elam's till their work was done 
Then returning home thinking of all the fun 
They had while together they did dwell 
And of the doggone sweet times which they loved so well

XVII. They thought as they went driving back to Delaware 
To the state where all things grow so nice & fair 
Soon if nothing happens and we stay well 
Well there, as one in doggone sweetness dwell

— Fanny D. Mast, July 7, 1940
